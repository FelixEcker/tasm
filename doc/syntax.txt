BASIC SYNTAX
COMMETING
The prefix for comments is the semi-colon. Anything on a line that comes after
a semicolon will be counted as a comment, as long as it is not placed within
a string.

ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES
Assembler directives must be prefixed with a dot. Valid assembler directives
are:

1. include PATH [section]
The include directive tells the assembler to paste the text from the specified
file at the point where it is located. A section like "text" or "data" can be
specified which will cause the assembler to simply include the text from that
specific section.

Any file ending in .s, .S or .asm will be preprocessed before being inserted.

2. nullpadding AMOUNT
The nullpadding directive tells the assembler to add AMOUNT of null-bytes before
the next part of the assembly result.

3. byte VALUE
The byte directive tells the assembler to place a byte of value VALUE within the
assembly at the point where the directive was called

4. bytes AMOUNT VALUE[ VALUE VALUE ...]
The bytes directive does the same as the byte directive but for multiple bytes.
AMOUNT specifies the number of bytes followed by the same number of values.

5. padding AMOUNT VALUE
The padding directive does the same as the nullpadding directive, but allows
to use VALUE as the padding byte.

6. text
The text directive starts the text section. This section contains the actual
instructions which will be assembled.

7. symbols
The symbols directive start the symbol section. This sections conatins all
symbol definitions.
